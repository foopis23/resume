We found that a lot of Tax Agencies were spending way to much time manually tracking their clients deadlines and meeting with them to explain simple questions. Our solution was to create an application what would act as the point of contact between the Tax Agency and the Customer. The Customer will see a list of deadlines and requirements on their so they can feel more confident about where they stand with their taxes, hopefully reducing the number of meeting and increasing the value of meetings that do happen. The Tax Agency will be able to use their list of clients to produce todo lists and reminders for their agents. This allows for Tax Agencies to plan and work more efficiently for busy seasons.",

I want a powerful, but opinionated task management software for people who think like me. The main idea is that \"tasks\" really fall into like 3 buckets. There are todo, events, and maintenance cycles. Todos are a list of things that can be completed immediately if necessary, like a traditional todo list. Events are things that need to be done at a specific time. Maintenance cycles are things that need to be done on a regular basis, but not at a specific time.",
